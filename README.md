# pau-gallardo-gnomes demo

This project retrieves data from (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrafols/mobile_test/master/data.json).

## You can find in the app:
* BEM
* Semantic HTML
* Unit and component testing (50+ coverage, all spare components tested)
* SASS
* Redux to handle local state
* Full responsive styles
* Bootstrap (To be more efficient)
* Environment variables
* SOLID
* DRY
* LightHouse (97/100 Performance, 79/100 Accesibility, 93/100 Best Practices, 100/100 SEO)
* ESLint
* SonarQube

## Requirements:
* Retrive data from the URL &#x2611; 
* UI must not blocked by network connections or long operations &#x2611;
* Images coming from network should cached to improve performance &#x2611;
* Full responsiveness &#x2611;
* I've used boostrap to be more efficient but I also developed Details page with SASS and BEM to probe I can use it &#x2611;

## and with more time:
* I would be recommended to add snapshot testing for every component that is considered DONE.
